### EmberScan's Mission
EmberScan is developed with the idea of using A.I image processing to identify housefires using the Alexnet.

EmberScan is a company dedicated to utilizing AI imaging technology for the vital task of identifying house fires. This approach holds significant importance because traditional smoke detectors can sometimes fail, leaving homes vulnerable to fires. EmberScan's mission is to offer a fail-safe solution to this problem by enabling home security cameras, or development cameras to detect house fires and promptly alert the appropriate authorities. This innovative use of AI image processing not only enhances fire safety but also ensures a more reliable and proactive response to fire threats, potentially saving lives and property.

## What EmberScan is trained to differentiate

### What is EmberScan trained off of
EmberScan is trained off the following data deck
[House Fires Data Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FMFFaQ2mH5CjzEbom0rSkPAUsbNTiWbb9yrRzbhVGGY/edit#slide=id.g206f8279a60_0_0)

## LLava Test

It can be seen that LLava will make up information if it does not undesstand everything about the photo. Llava was however able to identify that the house was on fire.
