### EmberScan's Mission
EmberScan is developed with the idea of using A.I image processing to identify housefires using the Alexnet.

EmberScan is a company dedicated to utilizing AI imaging technology for the vital task of identifying house fires. This approach holds significant importance because traditional smoke detectors can sometimes fail, leaving homes vulnerable to fire emergencies. EmberScan's mission is to offer a fail-safe solution to this problem by enabling home security cameras to detect house fires and promptly alert the appropriate authorities. This innovative use of AI not only enhances fire safety but also ensures a more reliable and proactive response to fire threats, potentially saving lives and property.
